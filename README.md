### Author: Riva Davidowski

**The purpose of this app is to venture away from React-land and revisit vanilla JS. I want to get back in touch with the DOM (not the Virtual DOM) for a nice refresher and build an app that builds on features throughout each phase.**

I love GIFs and decided to use the GIPHY Developer SDK, and created endpoints for:
 - all gifs
 - trending gifs
 - random gifs
 - tag terms
 - search

Users can:
  - Search for GIFs by entering a search term
  - Click on trending button and see trending gifs
  - Click on random button and see random gifs
  - Enter in a search term and search for gifs of their choosing
  - Get a list of tag terms related to the given tag on the GIPHY network (still somewhat in progress) by clicking on tags button

### Tools Used:

- Giphy Developers API
- Express.js
- Node.js
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Axios for AJAX calls
- Bootstrap icons

### How to use the app:

- Clone the repo and do an `npm i`. This will install all needed dependencies. 
- This project is not deployed as of yet and you will need your own API key (should you want to travel into the land of GIFS)
- You can check out the [GIPHY Developers Quick start](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide) guide to create an API key.
- Also see [API endpoints](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#search)
