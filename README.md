**The purpose of this app is to venture away from React-land. It is to revisit vanilla JS and get back in touch with the DOM. I love GIFs and decided to use the GIPHY Developer SDK, hit an API endpoint, and set up a back-end using Express.**

**The first version of this will be as mentioned above. For the second version, I will do a refactor of the app using React. Finally, for the last version, I shall give React Native a whirl and refactor this app to be a mobile application.**

**Users can:**
  - Search for GIFs by entering a search term
  - Filter GIFs based off mood


### Tools Used: 

- Giphy Developers API
- Express.js
- Node.js
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Axios for AJAX calls

### How to use the app:

- Clone the repo and do an `npm i`. This will install all needed dependencies.
