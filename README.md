**The purpose of this app is to venture away from React-land and revisit vanilla JS. I want to get back in touch with the HTML DOM (not the Virtual DOM) for a nice refresher and build an app that builds on features throughout each phase.**

**The first phase of this will be as mentioned above. For the second, I will do a refactor of the app using React. Finally, for the last phase, I shall revisit React Native and refactor this app to be a mobile application.**

**1st Phase: I love GIFs and decided to use the GIPHY Developer SDK, hit an API endpoint, and set up a back-end using Express.**

Users can:
  - Search for GIFs by entering a search term
  - Choose from trending and random gifs

**2nd Phase: Let's take it up a notch or two. This phase incorporates the backend from phase 1 and introduces new features:**

Users can: 
  - Get a list of tag terms related to the given tag on the GIPHY network
  - Select stickers 
  - Click on GIFs and see other GIFs that fall into the same category


### Tools Used Phase 1:

- Giphy Developers API
- Express.js
- Node.js
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Axios for AJAX calls
- Bootstrap icons

### Tools/Frameworks Used Phase 2:

- React
- Backend from phase 1
- Material-UI

### How to use the app:

- Clone the repo and do an `npm i`. This will install all needed dependencies.
